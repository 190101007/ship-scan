            <p>A Revolutionary Solution for Package Privacy</p>

            <p>These days, the protection of personal data in shipping processes has become a major concern. Shipping
                labels openly display sensitive information—names, addresses, and sometimes even package
                contents—leaving them vulnerable to privacy breaches. In some cases, courier employees, knowing which
                company sent the package, might even tear open the parcel out of mere curiosity.</p>

            <p>To solve this problem, I developed a QR code-based system that keeps shipping details secure. Instead of
                printing personal information on labels, all data is encrypted and stored inside a QR code. Only
                authorized personnel can access this information, with different levels of visibility. For example,
                warehouse staff can see full details, while delivery personnel only get the necessary info for drop-off.
                Anyone without app access won’t be able to view any data at all.</p>

            <p>The system is designed exclusively for the shipping company, meaning no external party can decode the
                encrypted QR data. It includes both authorization and authentication mechanisms to ensure top-level
                security.</p>

            <p>With this solution, customers' personal data stays protected, and the shipping process becomes more
                secure. No more unnecessary package tampering or unauthorized access to address details.</p>

            <p>In short, this project aims to close privacy gaps in the shipping industry and create a safer experience
                for both senders and recipients.</p>
